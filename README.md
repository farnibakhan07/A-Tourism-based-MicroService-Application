# A Microservice based tourism application
An application to the most attractive tourist places in a city using RESTful API. These APIs will only provide three services:
1. For a given city anywhere in the world, it will list the name, address and type of popular places in the that city.
2. It will recommend the tourist some famous places to visit based on the date they are planning to travel and the weather condition.
3  It will also give some suggestions for accommodation and find out the city names based on country.
